            <p>The name "C sharp" was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.[26] This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.[27]
                Due to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (U+266F ♯ MUSIC SHARP SIGN (HTML &#9839;)) is not present on the standard keyboard, the number sign (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN (HTML &#35;)) was chosen to represent the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.[28] This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification.[9] However, when it is practical to do so (for example, in advertising or in box art[29]), Microsoft uses the intended musical symbol.

            <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,[3] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[4] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[3] but it now stands for the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[5]

                PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management system and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page.

            <p>MySQL (officially pronounced as /maɪ ˌɛskjuːˈɛl/ "My S-Q-L",[5]) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[6] In July 2013, it was the world's second most[a] widely used RDBMS, and the most widely used open-source client–server model RDBMS.[9] It is named after Michael Widenius' (who is a co-founder of MySQL) daughter, My,[10] while "SQL" stands as the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.[11] For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality.
